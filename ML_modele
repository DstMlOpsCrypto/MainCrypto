# MODELS SELECTION

This part is a sum up of various sources and  show some codes exemple that need to be finetuned for the project.

## Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. It predicts the price based on a weighted sum of the input features.

### Usage:

- Data Preparation: Ensure your data is clean and normalized.
- Feature Selection: Choose relevant features like historical prices, trading volume, and market sentiment.
- Model Training: Use libraries like scikit-learn in Python to train the model.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

### Usage:

- Data Preparation: Similar to Linear Regression.
- Feature Selection: Include technical indicators and historical prices.
- Model Training: Use scikit-learn to train the Random Forest model.
- Evaluation: Use metrics like RMSE and MAE.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVM is a powerful classification and regression technique that finds the hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes.

### Usage:

- Data Preparation: Normalize the data.
- Feature Selection: Use historical prices and technical indicators.
- Model Training: Use scikit-learn to train the SVM model.
- Evaluation: Evaluate using metrics like MAE and RMSE.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVR
model = SVR(kernel='rbf')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series prediction due to its ability to remember long-term dependencies.

### Usage:

- Data Preparation: Normalize and reshape the data for LSTM input.
- Feature Selection: Use historical prices and trading volumes.
- Model Training: Use libraries like TensorFlow or Keras to build and train the LSTM model.
- Evaluation: Use metrics like RMSE and MAE.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dense(1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNNs are typically used for image data but can be adapted for time series prediction by treating the time series as a one-dimensional image.

### Usage:

- Data Preparation: Normalize and reshape the data for CNN input.
- Feature Selection: Use historical prices and technical indicators.
- Model Training: Use TensorFlow or Keras to build and train the CNN model.
- Evaluation: Use metrics like RMSE and MAE.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=2, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(50, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Transformer Models

Transformer models, known for their success in natural language processing, can also be applied to time series prediction due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies.

### Usage:

- Data Preparation: Normalize and reshape the data for Transformer input.
- Feature Selection: Use historical prices, trading volumes, and technical indicators.
- Model Training: Use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build and train the Transformer model.
- Evaluation: Use metrics like RMSE and MAE.

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

class TransformerModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, model_dim, num_heads, num_layers):
        super(TransformerModel, self).__init__()
        self.transformer = nn.Transformer(d_model=model_dim, nhead=num_heads, num_encoder_layers=num_layers)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(model_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, src):
        output = self.transformer(src)
        output = self.fc(output[-1])
        return output

model = TransformerModel(input_dim=10, model_dim=512, num_heads=8, num_layers=6)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(X_train)
    loss = criterion(output, y_train)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Prediction

predictions = model(X_test)
